# High-Level Steps for a Rubik's Cube Solver Using Static Images

## 1. Capture Images of Each Face
- Use a camera to take clear images of each of the six faces of the Rubik's cube.
- Ensure consistent lighting and minimal shadows to improve color detection accuracy.

## 2. Preprocess the Images
- **Resize and Crop:** Resize the images if necessary and crop them to focus on the Rubik's cube.
- **Convert to HSV:** Convert the images from the RGB color space to the HSV color space using OpenCV for more reliable color detection.

## 3. Detect the Cube Grid
- **Contour Detection:** Use OpenCV’s contour detection to identify the boundaries of the Rubik's cube.
- **Grid Segmentation:** Divide the detected face into a 3x3 grid, corresponding to the 9 squares on each face of the Rubik's cube.

## 4. Color Detection
- **Define Color Ranges:** Predefine HSV ranges for each of the Rubik's cube colors (red, green, blue, yellow, white, orange).
- **Identify Colors:** For each square in the 3x3 grid, determine the dominant color using the predefined HSV ranges.

## 5. Build the Cube State Representation
- **Map Colors to Cube Faces:** Create a data structure (e.g., a 2D array) to store the color of each square for all six faces of the Rubik's cube.

## 6. Solve the Rubik’s Cube
- **Use the Kociemba Algorithm:** Pass the cube's state representation to the Kociemba algorithm (using the Kociemba library) to calculate the sequence of moves needed to solve the cube.

## 7. Display the Solution
- **Output the Moves:** Display the solution steps (e.g., U, D, L, R, F, B) that will solve the Rubik's cube from the current scrambled state.
- **Visualization (Optional):** Create a simple visual representation of the Rubik’s cube and show the solution step by step.

## 8. Testing and Refinement
- **Test Accuracy:** Verify the color detection accuracy by testing with different cubes and lighting conditions.
- **Refine HSV Ranges:** Adjust the predefined HSV ranges if necessary to improve detection accuracy.

## Summary
- Capture images of each Rubik's cube face.
- Preprocess and segment each face into a 3x3 grid.
- Detect the color of each square using predefined HSV ranges.
- Build the cube's state and solve it using the Kociemba algorithm.
- Output the solution in a step-by-step format.

This static image approach simplifies the problem compared to a real-time video implementation and allows you to focus on accurate color detection and solving logic.
