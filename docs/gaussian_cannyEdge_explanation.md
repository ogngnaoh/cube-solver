### 1. **Gaussian Filter Parameters**

The Gaussian filter is used to blur the image, which helps reduce noise and minor details, making edge detection more robust. The key parameters are the kernel size and the standard deviation (sigma).

- **Kernel Size (5x5):**
  - **Reasoning:** The kernel size determines the area over which the filter is applied. A 5x5 kernel size is a common choice that provides a good balance between smoothing and retaining important features. It's large enough to reduce noise but not so large that it overly blurs the image.
  - **Effect:** If the kernel size is too small (e.g., 3x3), it may not adequately reduce noise. If it's too large (e.g., 7x7 or more), it may blur important edges, making them harder to detect later.
  - **Formula:** The kernel size is usually chosen as an odd number (e.g., 3x3, 5x5) to ensure that there is a center pixel for the filter to focus on.

- **Standard Deviation (sigma = 0):**
  - **Reasoning:** The standard deviation determines the spread of the Gaussian function. In OpenCV, setting sigma to 0 lets the function automatically calculate it based on the kernel size. This automatic calculation usually works well for typical applications.
  - **Effect:** A smaller sigma would result in less blurring, while a larger sigma would result in more blurring. By setting it to 0, the blurring effect is optimized for the chosen kernel size.
  
### 2. **Canny Edge Detection Parameters**

The Canny edge detector is used to find edges in the image. The key parameters are the lower and upper thresholds for the hysteresis procedure.

- **Lower Threshold (50) and Upper Threshold (150):**
  - **Reasoning:** The Canny algorithm works by finding areas of the image with a gradient (change in intensity) that exceeds the upper threshold. Pixels with a gradient below the lower threshold are discarded, and those between the two thresholds are included if they are connected to a pixel above the upper threshold.
  - **Effect:** 
    - **Lower Threshold (50):** Sets the sensitivity for detecting weak edges. A lower value makes the detector more sensitive, potentially detecting more edges but also more noise.
    - **Upper Threshold (150):** Determines the strong edge criterion. A higher value reduces sensitivity, focusing on more prominent edges.
  - **Balancing Act:** These values (50 and 150) are chosen to balance the detection of important edges while avoiding excessive noise. If both thresholds are set too high, you may miss some edges. If both are too low, you may detect too much noise.

- **Why 50 and 150?**
  - These values are common defaults in computer vision tasks and often provide good results in typical scenarios. However, the exact values may need adjustment depending on the specific characteristics of the images you are processing (e.g., lighting conditions, noise level, contrast).
  - **Testing:** It's often recommended to experiment with these values in your specific application. If your images are noisier or have lower contrast, you might lower the thresholds slightly. For very sharp, high-contrast images, you might increase them.

### Summary:
- **Gaussian Filter (5x5, sigma=0):** Provides a good balance between noise reduction and edge retention.
- **Canny Edge Detection (50, 150):** Balances sensitivity to weak and strong edges, aiming to detect meaningful edges while minimizing noise.

These parameter values are often used as starting points, but you can fine-tune them based on the specific requirements of your Rubik's cube images by testing different configurations and observing the results.
