### **Function Breakdown**

#### **1. Check Number of Vertices**
```python
if len(approx) != 4:
    return False
```
- **Explanation**: 
  - The function first checks if the approximated contour (`approx`) has exactly four vertices. A square, by definition, should have four sides, so if the contour doesn't have four vertices, it cannot be a square.
  - **Return**: If the contour does not have four vertices, the function immediately returns `False`.

#### **2. Define Side Length Calculation**
```python
def side_length(p1, p2):
    return np.sqrt((p1[0] - p2[0])**2 + (p1[1] - p2[1])**2)
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This inner function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points `p1` and `p2`, which represents the length of a side of the polygon.
  - The formula used is the standard distance formula in 2D space: \(\text{distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}\).

#### **3. Calculate Side Lengths**
```python
side_lengths = [
    side_length(approx[0][0], approx[1][0]),
    side_length(approx[1][0], approx[2][0]),
    side_length(approx[2][0], approx[3][0]),
    side_length(approx[3][0], approx[0][0])
]
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The function calculates the lengths of all four sides of the polygon by calling `side_length` on each pair of consecutive vertices.

#### **4. Check Side Length Consistency**
```python
avg_length = np.mean(side_lengths)
for length in side_lengths:
    if abs(length - avg_length) > 0.1 * avg_length:
        return False
```
- **Explanation**:
  - **`avg_length`**: The function computes the average length of the four sides.
  - The function then checks if each side length is within 10% of the average length (`0.1 * avg_length`). If any side deviates more than this threshold, the function concludes that the polygon is not a square and returns `False`.
  - **Why?**: For a polygon to be a square, all its sides must be roughly equal in length.

#### **5. Define Angle Calculation**
```python
def angle(p1, p2, p3):
    v1 = np.array(p1) - np.array(p2)
    v2 = np.array(p3) - np.array(p2)
    cosine_angle = np.dot(v1, v2) / (np.linalg.norm(v1) * np.linalg.norm(v2))
    angle_rad = np.arccos(cosine_angle)
    angle_deg = np.degrees(angle_rad)
    return angle_deg
```
- **Explanation**:
  - This inner function calculates the angle between two vectors formed by three points `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
  - **`v1`**: The vector from `p2` to `p1`.
  - **`v2`**: The vector from `p2` to `p3`.
  - **`cosine_angle`**: The cosine of the angle between the two vectors, calculated using the dot product formula.
  - **`angle_rad`**: The angle in radians, found using the inverse cosine (`arccos`) function.
  - **`angle_deg`**: The angle in degrees, converted from radians using `np.degrees`.

#### **6. Calculate and Check Angles**
```python
angles = [
    angle(approx[0][0], approx[1][0], approx[2][0]),
    angle(approx[1][0], approx[2][0], approx[3][0]),
    angle(approx[2][0], approx[3][0], approx[0][0]),
    angle(approx[3][0], approx[0][0], approx[1][0])
]

for angle in angles:
    if abs(angle - 90) > 10:
        return False
```
- **Explanation**:
  - The function calculates the internal angles between consecutive sides of the polygon.
  - **Check**: Each angle is compared to 90 degrees (the expected angle in a square). If any angle deviates by more than 10 degrees from 90, the function concludes that the polygon is not a square and returns `False`.

#### **7. Return True if All Checks Pass**
```python
return True
```
- **Explanation**:
  - If the polygon has four sides of roughly equal length and all internal angles are approximately 90 degrees, the function returns `True`, indicating that the contour is indeed a square.

### **Summary**
- **Vertex Check**: Ensures the contour has four vertices.
- **Side Length Check**: Ensures all sides are of similar length.
- **Angle Check**: Ensures all internal angles are approximately 90 degrees.

This function is useful in detecting squares within an image, such as identifying the square faces or stickers of a Rubik's cube in computer vision tasks.
