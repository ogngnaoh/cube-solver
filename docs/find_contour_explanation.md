### **1. Contours**

**`contours`**: 
- This is a list that will store the contours found in the image. Each contour is represented as a NumPy array of coordinates outlining the shape of an object in the image. For example, a contour of a square might be stored as an array of four coordinate points, each representing a corner.

### **2. Ignoring the Hierarchy**

**`_`**:
- The underscore (`_`) is a placeholder that captures the second return value of `cv2.findContours`, which represents the contour hierarchy. In this specific case, the hierarchy is not needed, so it is captured with `_` to indicate that this value is intentionally ignored.

### **3. `cv2.findContours` Function**

**`cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)`**:
- This is the function used to find contours in a binary image (an image that has been processed to highlight edges, such as the result from the Canny edge detection method used in your code).

Letâ€™s break down the arguments passed to this function:

#### **a. `edges` (First Argument)**
- **`edges`**: This is the source image in which contours are to be detected. It should be a binary image (i.e., an image where the pixels are either black or white). This image is usually the result of an edge detection algorithm, like the Canny edge detector, which identifies sharp changes in intensity, usually corresponding to object boundaries.

#### **b. `cv2.RETR_TREE` (Second Argument)**
- **`cv2.RETR_TREE`**: This specifies the contour retrieval mode, which defines how contours are retrieved and organized.
  
  - **Details**:
    - **`cv2.RETR_TREE`**: This mode retrieves all the contours and reconstructs a full hierarchy of nested contours. This means it will not only find the outermost contours (as some other modes do) but will also build a tree structure showing the relationship between contours and their parent-child hierarchy. This is useful if you need to understand the nested structure of objects within an image, such as in cases where one object is inside another.

  - **Why `cv2.RETR_TREE` is Used Here**:
    - While the code only uses the largest contour, `cv2.RETR_TREE` is chosen perhaps for flexibility, allowing you to potentially analyze the relationships between contours if needed. In some cases, understanding which contours are inside others could be important, although in this case, only the largest one is used.

#### **c. `cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE` (Third Argument)**
- **`cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE`**: This is the contour approximation method, which controls how much detail is stored in the contour points.
  
  - **Details**:
    - **`cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE`**: This method compresses the contour points by removing all redundant points and retaining only the essential points that form the shape of the contour. For example, if you have a straight line, instead of storing every point along the line, it would store just the two endpoints, significantly reducing memory usage and simplifying the contour data.

  - **Why `cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE` is Used Here**:
    - This method is typically chosen to optimize memory usage and processing time by simplifying the contour data. In many cases, especially in object detection, only the general shape of the object is needed, so simplifying the contour to its essential points is beneficial.

### **Summary of the Entire Line**
This line of code:
```
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(edges, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```
- **Contours Extraction**: It identifies and extracts the contours from the `edges` image, which represent the boundaries of objects within that image.
- **Hierarchy Handling**: It uses the `cv2.RETR_TREE` mode to potentially handle nested contours in a structured manner, although the hierarchy isn't used in this particular function.
- **Contour Simplification**: It simplifies the contour data with `cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE`, storing only the critical points that define the contours.

In the context of the larger function, this step is part of the process to identify the outlines of objects in the image, with the ultimate goal of isolating and processing the Rubik's cube face for further analysis.
